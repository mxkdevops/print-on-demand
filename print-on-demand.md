### Tips for starting with print on demand
 1. Always order samples
2.  Be strategic about shipping
    - Conditional free shipping (e.g., “Get free shipping when you spend $30 or more”)
    -  encourages customers to add more to their cart to reach the threshold and usually
    -  helps you achieve a better total shipping rate by shipping everything together.
3. Create mockups that show off your products
4. Find your niche and build an audience
   -Spend $10 on Facebook ads (to start) to test your products with your target market.
5. Create your own online store
6. Design, test, sell, and grow
